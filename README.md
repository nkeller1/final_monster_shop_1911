## User Roles available in this e-commerce solution

0. Visitor - this type of user is anonymously browsing our site and is not logged in, can place items in the cart but cannot check out.
1. Regular User - this user is registered and logged in to the application while performing their work; can place items in a cart and create an order by checking out with their cart.
2. Merchant Employee - this user works for a merchant. They can fulfill orders on behalf of their merchant. They also have the same permissions as a regular user (adding items to a cart and checking out).
3. Admin User - a registered user who has "superuser" access to all areas of the application; user is logged in to perform their work

## Order Progression in this ecommerce solution

1. 'pending' means a user has placed items in a cart and "checked out" to create an order, merchants may or may not have fulfilled any items yet
2. 'packaged' means all merchants have fulfilled their items for the order, and has been packaged and ready to ship
3. 'shipped' means an admin has 'shipped' a package and can no longer be cancelled by a user
4. 'cancelled' - only 'pending' and 'packaged' orders can be cancelled
